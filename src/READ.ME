The project is in ROS but it calls a few functions that are called within virtual environments. To build the virtualenv:

Create Virtualenv gal@gushu:~$ virtualenv -p python3 ./ToiBotEnv
Activate source ToiBotEnv/bin/activate
Go into folder Cd ToiBotEnv
Get pip sudo apt-get install python3-pip
Get some dependencies sudo pip3 install ohbot sudo apt-get install festival sudo apt-get install python3-lxml
If dependencies are installed here: /usr/local/lib/python3.6/dist-packages/ohbot Move them manually to new env: /home/gal/ToiBotEnv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ohbot
Give permissions to use port sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
Run test script to check it speaks and moves
Connect script to dialogFlow agent: export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/home/path/to/your/json/file.json"
Try to run and Get dependencies: pip3 install pyaudio Pip install dialogflow
Change paths to: Sound files Google credentials
